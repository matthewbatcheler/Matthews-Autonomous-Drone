This project was created for the REC foundation stay-at-home drone competition. 
The system uses a Kinect depth camera to track the drone, several PID loops to determine the necessary power to apply to each control axis, then an Arduino and NRF24L01 radio to send the commands to the drone, mimicking the handset.
